/*
Just as a language has nouns, verbs, etc., JavaScript has its own building blocks; developers call them data types.
There are three essential data types to know for now:
1. String: Any grouping of words or numbers surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes: " ... ".
2. Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals, without quotes: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
3. Boolean: This is always one two words. Either true or false, with no quotations.

var myNumber = 37;

// Do not edit the code under this line
console.log("Name: " + myString);
console.log("Lucky Number: " + myNumber);
console.log("Good joke? " + myBoolean);
